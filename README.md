# Full Stack Expo App

Without ejecting, we're able to connect an Expo app to MetaMask via WalletConnect.

## What new

- Polyfilling NodeJS libraries within [metro.config.js](./metro.config.js)
- Creating and updating [global.ts](./global.ts)

## Run this on your own
- clone repo
- yarn install
- expo start
- scan QR code

# Goals:
Be able to make authenticated API calls via an authenticated wallet
